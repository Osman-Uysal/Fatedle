    <p id="narrative">As the final moments of your life slip away, you feel the crushing weight of mortality bearing down on you. Your breaths come in shallow gasps, each one harder to draw than the last. You reach out for help, but no one is there to save you. The world around you fades into darkness, and you are left alone with your thoughts. Memories flood your mind, each one a reminder of the life you are about to leave behind. Regrets and missed opportunities fill you with a sense of profound sadness, and you can't help but wonder what could have been different if you had only made different choices. But it's too late now, and as the final breath leaves your body, you feel yourself slipping away into the void.</p>
